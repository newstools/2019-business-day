Capitec’s headline earnings in the year ended February rose 19% to R5.3bn as the banking group’s client base grew by 15% to 11.4-million customers, it said on Thursday. The lender, which said its return on equity for the year was 28%, raised its total dividend per share by 19% to R17.50. “The industry is experiencing a challenging economic climate in addition to the prospect of new competitors,” Capitec said. “Our strategy remains to focus on our clients with a combination of digital banking, a branch network and relevant and insightful communication to help them bank better.” New entrants include Discovery Bank, Bank Zero and TymeBank. Capitec said net transaction-fee income grew by 26% to R6.5bn as clients continued to move from cash to card-based transactions. “The risk of cash handling in SA has increased significantly over the last few years,” the company said. Interest income, however, was flat at R15.5bn. Capitec, which is in the process of acquiring Mercantile Bank to speed up its entry into the business banking market, said retail deposits increased by 23% to R71bn. Meanwhile, it said its credit card product “has been well-received by the market”. At the end of February, the gross credit card book was R3.6bn, or 3% of the total SA retail credit card market. “Our continued investment in new payment solutions, digital development and advanced data and analytics will allow us to offer retail clients easier ways to bank and more personalised credit offers,” Capitec said. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
