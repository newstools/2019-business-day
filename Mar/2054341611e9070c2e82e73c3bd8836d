The JSE edged lower on Thursday morning as global growth fears and a weaker rand prompted broad-based losses. The resource index eked out some gains, however, boosted by a rising oil price and rand weakness. The local currency has pushed towards R14.50/$, weakening overnight after British MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit. This sent the rand to a four-month low against the pound. Chinese data was disappointing, with industrial production falling to a 17-year low in January. US President Donald Trump also said on Wednesday he is “in no rush” to make a trade deal with China, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
