Sydney — Oil prices edged higher on Wednesday, supported by planned cuts to Saudi exports and a reduced forecast for US crude output. International Brent crude oil futures were at $66.93 a barrel at 12.39am GMT, up 26c, or 0.4%, from their last close. Brent touched $67.39 a barrel on Monday, its highest since February 25. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $57.17 a barrel, up 30c, or 0.5%, from their last settlement. US crude oil production is expected to grow slower than previously expected in 2019 and average about 12.30-million barrels a day the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday. Saudi Arabia plans to cut its crude oil exports in April to less than 7-million barrels a day, while keeping its output well below 10-million barrels a day, a Saudi official said on Monday, as the kingdom seeks to drain a supply glut and support oil prices. On Sunday, Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said it would be too early to change Opec-plus output policy at the group’s meeting in April. Reuters
