Sydney — Oil prices fell on Thursday, extending losses into a second straight session, after widely watched data showed a surprising increase in US stocks. International Brent crude oil futures were at $67.63 a barrel at 12.45am GMT, down 20 cents, or 0.3%, from their last close. Brent closed down 0.2% on Wednesday. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $59.18 per barrel, down 23 cents, or 0.4%, from their last settlement. WTI fell 0.9% on Wednesday. Prices came under pressure from a rise in US inventories, though analysts pointed to support from efforts by Opec and non-affiliated allies such as Russia, known as Opec-plus, to trim output. “Today’s fall does not derail the short-term bullish argument that both the Opec-plus production cuts and supply outages will outweigh the global growth concerns and rising US production,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. US crude inventories rose last week by 2.8-million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 1.2-million barrels, the US Energy Information Administration said. Crude exports fell by 506,000 barrels per day, the administration said. Offering support for prices, oil output from Russia, Opec’s biggest non-member ally, averaged 11.3-million barrels per day so far in March, a source said, compared with 11.34-million barrels a day the previous month.
