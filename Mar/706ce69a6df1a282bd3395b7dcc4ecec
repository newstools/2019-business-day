Old Mutual CEO Peter Moyo says investor confidence in SA remains “fragile” owing to concerns about government debt and the state’s proposed land expropriation framework. “The economic outlook has marginally improved relative to the previous year, resulting in some increase in business and consumer confidence. “However, investor confidence is still fragile with concerns around government debt levels and policy uncertainty particularly around the proposed policy on land expropriation without compensation,” Moyo wrote in Old Mutual’s annual report. But despite the weak growth outlook in SA, coupled with macroeconomic risks and “strong competitive pressures”, the group was confident it would reach its medium-term targets, he said. Including R15.4m in incentives related to Old Mutual’s managed separation process, Moyo’s total remuneration for 2018 amounted to R35.6m, the group’s annual report shows. Old Mutual completed a managed separation programme in 2018, with the listing of Old Mutual Limited on five different exchanges in June 2018 and the unbundling of 32% of Nedbank in October. Old Mutual chair Trevor Manuel, who is a former finance minister and one of the investment envoys appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa to sell SA to investors, wrote in the report that the economic environment in SA remains very difficult. “We express the view that the anticipated return to political stability after the elections in SA will be important for the growth of the economy, to create new opportunities for employment and reignite the conditions for the expansion of the Old Mutual platform,” Manuel said. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
