Growthpoint Properties says it turned down Edcon’s request for a rental reduction. While the SA property giant participated in Edcon’s restructuring, by providing it with an injection of R110m in return for an equity stake, Growthpoint said a rental reduction for the troubled retail group would not have been in line with its own strategy. “Growthpoint was among the landlords approached in December 2018 to consider a rental reduction for retail space leased to Edcon's brands. “Given that our business model is based on contractual leases that provide a steady stream of annuity income, we did not want to compromise this by agreeing to the request for a rental reduction,” it said on Wednesday. Growthpoint said it had already decreased its exposure to the retail group by about 9,000m² since the end of 2017. Its exposure was expected to decrease by at least another 18,000m² over the next two years. Edcon’s R2.7bn recapitalisation deal involved landlords, the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and banks. As many as 31 landlords, including Growthpoint, Vukile Property Fund, Liberty Two Degrees and Hyprop Investments, have met Edcon over the past few months. Many landlords agreed to reduce rent for Edcon stores in exchange for a stake in the business in a bid to stave off liquidation and save jobs. Edcon employs 40,000 people. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
