Technology group Altron said on Thursday that Cedric Miller would take over as chief financial officer in May. Miller, who has held senior positions at Standard Bank, “has a strong commercial acumen and a proven record of delivering insights into strategy implementation and executive decision-making in high-performance teams”, Altron said. Miller’s roles at Standard Bank included global chief financial officer for personal and business banking, finance chief for the global investment banking division, and operations head of Standard Bank’s subsidiary in Argentina. Andrew Holden, Altron’s chief operating officer, would step down as acting finance chief at the end of April, the group said. Altron’s shares have risen about 47% over the past year thanks to renewed investor confidence in the group, which now counts Value Capital Partners as a strategic investor. CEO Mteto Nyati joined the group in April 2017, when Altron was shifted from a family-run business into a professionally managed one. He has focused on reducing debt, selling noncore assets, and strengthening the board. Altron's previous permanent finance chief, Alex Smith, stepped down at the end of February 2018. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
