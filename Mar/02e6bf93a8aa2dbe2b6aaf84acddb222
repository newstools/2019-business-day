Sasfin  said on Tuesday headline earnings grew 59.9% to R80.5m in the six months to December, thanks to a lower tax bill and a healthier credit book. The group said its credit loss ratio improved to 1.23%, from 2% a year before, while its tax expense “normalised”, falling to R30.3m from R47.5m. “Over the past two years, the group expressed concern around the deteriorating performance of its credit book and subsequently took significant steps to improve its credit processes and team,” Sasfin said. However, the financial services company said costs were growing at a faster pace than income. Total income grew 5.8% to R608.6m “in a subdued economy”, while costs grew by 12.3% due to an increase in headcount following the acquisition of Absa Technology Finance Solutions, investments in the business, and an increase in bonus provisions. As a result, the group's cost-to-income ratio deteriorated to 74% from 70.4%. Sasfin, headed by Michael Sassoon, said its total assets grew by 3.1% to R13.6bn, with gross loans and advances growing by 8.7% thanks to the Absa deal. In its wealth division, assets under management and advice — excluding those under administration — decreased by 5.6% to R37.2bn as equity markets fell. “While local markets have been challenging, there are good growth prospects in our offshore offering,” the group said. Sasfin noted that SA’s deteriorating fiscal situation had been aggravated by the increasing liabilities associated with under-performing state-owned entities, particularly Eskom. This had limited fixed-investment projects, “and uncertain property rights weighs negatively on business and investor confidence”. Sasfin declared a gross cash preference dividend of 418.09c a share, down from 427.42c per share a year before. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
