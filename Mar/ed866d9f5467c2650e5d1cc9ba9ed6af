The government has finally removed convicted fraudster Rubben Mohlaloga from his post as chair of the Independent Communications Authority of SA (Icasa). Communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has given effect to the National Assembly resolution to fire Mohlaloga, her department said on Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, the National Assembly resolved to remove Mohlaloga as a councillor and chair of the authority with immediate effect. Mohlaloga was convicted of fraud and money laundering in January 2018, soon after his appointment was approved by former president Jacob Zuma. He and three others defrauded the Land Bank to the tune of R6m in 2008, when he was chair of parliament’s agriculture portfolio committee. The Icasa act prohibits anyone convicted of fraud from serving as a councillor. In mid-February 2019, the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court sentenced him to 20 years in prison. The department said in its statement on Wednesday the Icasa council had been instructed to elect an acting chair, and the process to find a permanent replacement “will soon commence”. Parliament has, until recently, been uncertain about the best way to deal with Mohlaloga, as he had argued against his removal from office, saying he would appeal against his conviction and sentence. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
