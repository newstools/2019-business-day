Bidvest has increased its interim dividend by 10.6% to R2.82, as higher margins made up for marginal revenue growth in the six months to end-December. The trading, distribution and services group said on Monday it had produced “a good result”, despite the frail economy and business, and political uncertainty. Bidvest’s headline earnings increased by 10% to R2.1bn, even as group revenue inched up 0.2% to R40bn. This was partly thanks to a 120 basis point increase in the group’s gross profit margin, to 29.3%. Bidvest, which is headed by Bidvest CEO Lindsay Ralphs, said its services, freight and office and print divisions contributed “standout performances”. The company’s income from investments rose to R86.5m, from R24.9m a year before, partly thanks to the disposal of Bidcorp shares. Bidvest owns large stakes in Bidvest Namibia, Adcock Ingram, Comair and Mumbai Airport, among other investments. The group said the Bidvest Freight unit’s R1bn liquefied petroleum gas project was on schedule. The facility is expected to launch in mid-2020. Meanwhile, Bidvest said it expected “continued growth” for the rest of its financial year. “Pockets of activity and opportunities exist across the economy and the group is well positioned to participate in these,” it said. However, economic growth, industrial activity and consumer spending were likely to remain “lacklustre” until certainty emerged in the wake of SA’s national election in May. “The economic damage caused by corruption will take time to remedy,” Bidvest said. “Government’s ability to drive infrastructural spending, initiation of development programmes and ongoing maintenance in key entities and facilities remains critical to kick-start the economy.” hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
