Viv Govender from Rand Swiss Offshore chose Sanlam Capital Protector as his stock pick of the day. “This is quite an interesting product, it gives you 90% capital protection so the first 10% you take as a loss, but what they do then is they choose a bunch of different stocks around the world and then they basically give you 200% of that improvement after taxes returned. The actual return is like 300%, but they account for the full tax rate so whatever the improvement in the stocks are you get 200% after the tax as your return.”
