Steinhoff International Holdings’ Unitrans Motor Group, which the embattled retailer is in talks to sell, may be valued at as much as $280m, according to people familiar with the matter. The lower end of the valuation range may be about $204m, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private. Steinhoff on Thursday said it plans to sell 75% of SA’s largest car dealership to the local unit of Toyota Tsusho Corporation’s CFAO Holdings as it exits businesses that do not complement existing retail franchises. The companies still need to agree terms for the sale, Steinhoff said in a statement. Steinhoff declined to comment on Unitrans Motor’s value, while CFAO would not say what price it may pay. Steinhoff raised about $332m earlier this week as it sold its remaining shares in SA’s KAP Industrial Holdings. That followed similar disposals of stock in Pepkor Holdings, Steinhoff’s African retail operations and investment-holdings company PSG Group. The SA company is also seeking to sell properties in Europe valued at about €400m, people familiar with the matter said earlier in March. Steinhoff first began buying shares in Unitrans in 2000. It continued increasing its stake to just more than 60% until acquiring all of the outstanding stock for the equivalent of $233m in 2007. “We’ve been looking to enter SA for many years,” CFAO chair and CEO Richard Bielle said by phone. “It is a significant acquisition for the group. We would like to expand these types of services in Unitrans to our other operations in Africa.” Bielle said CFAO is financing the deal through a combination of debt and equity. Bloomberg
