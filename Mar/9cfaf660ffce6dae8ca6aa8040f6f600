The stalled liquidation of the Bosasa group of companies has delayed the corruption case against the group’s former COO, Angelo Agrizzi, and former company employees and prison bosses. On Wednesday, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) postponed the corruption case against Agrizzi, former Bosasa CFO Andries van Tonder and former correctional services bosses Linda Mti and Patrick Gillingham to  July 5. Prosecutor Peter Serunye said the state wanted to join three Bosasa companies as accused in the case — but this process had been put on hold pending the finalisation of legal battles over the group’s liquidation. Earlier in March, the Bosasa group (now trading as African Global Operations) applied for voluntary liquidation, which it later successfully reversed in the Johannesburg high court. The liquidators were granted leave to appeal against that decision in the Supreme Court of Appeal. It is that appeal that the NPA says needs to be finalised, in order for it to decide if and how the Bosasa companies can be charged. Agrizzi and his co-accuses have been charged with tender rigging and corruption linked to a 2009 Special Investigating Unit report into the department of correctional services. The report revealed alleged corruption in four tenders valued at more than R1bn. Despite being charged, Agrizzi says he will return to the state capture inquiry on Thursday to give further testimony about alleged Bosasa corruption and fraud.
