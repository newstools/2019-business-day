Wayne McCurrie from FNB Wealth and Investments chose Growthpoint as his stock pick of the day and David Shapiro from Sasfin Securities chose Nvidia. McCurrie said: “The company’s yield is approaching 9% which has not happened in a while.” Shapiro said: “Nvidia is a chip maker and the company has been under a lot of pressure due to issues with cryptocurrencies, which resulted in the stock falling. But now they purchased Mellanox Technologies for more than $7bn and the Nvidia stock, although it seems expensive, is starting to turn around.”
