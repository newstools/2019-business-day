Wayne McCurrie from FNB Wealth and Investments chose Transaction Capital as his stock pick of the day and David Shapiro of Sasfin Securities chose Airbus. McCurrie said: “Transaction Capital is doing very well and is operating in an industry that is tough but clearly they understand it. They are expanding in their product ranges, their debt collection side is doing very well and also expanding overseas. The stock is trading at a reasonably low price-earnings ratio and you should have fairly good earnings.” Shapiro said: “It’s just one of my big themes at the moment, international travel, particularly the Chinese and Asia. With Boeing under pressure, Airbus has done incredibly well.”
