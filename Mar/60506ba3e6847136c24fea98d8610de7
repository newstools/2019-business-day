Steinhoff International Holdings former non-executive director Johan Van Zyl says the long-awaited probe into an accounting scandal that almost destroyed the SA retailer reveals “fraud on a grand scale.” Van Zyl, who quit just two days before a tempestuous annual shareholder meeting in Amsterdam in April, says in an interview with CNBC Africa a forensic report by PwC focuses on the wrongdoing of a “few individuals”. He did not name them. The report will be published “soon,” he said. Those affected by the scandal want the authorities to prosecute wrongdoers, and people should “pay for their actions”, Van Zyl said. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Bloomberg
