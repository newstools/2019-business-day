MTN, whose shares have been battered by regulatory troubles across its portfolio of 21 markets, has raised its medium-term revenue targets and announced plans to sell at least R15bn worth of assets to reduce debt. That helped boost the mobile operator’s stock, which jumped as much as 12.9% before midday on Thursday to R85.85, reversing the share’s declines in recent trading days. Excelsia Capital analyst Mark Narramore said there had been plenty of short positions in MTN’s shares, which meant a “short squeeze” was possible. A short squeeze is a sharp increase in the price of a stock when short-sellers — investors who had bet against the share — cover their positions. MTN CEO Rob Shuter said on Thursday morning that after the group’s revenues accelerated in the year to end-December, it decided to raise its guidance for service-revenue growth from high single digits to double-digit growth. The mobile operator was also targeting a return-on-equity ratio of above 20%, from 11.5% in 2018, he said. Moreover, MTN planned asset sales of at least R15bn over the next three years, excluding any proceeds it may get from its R23bn investment in tower company IHS. As part of those plans, Shuter said MTN would sell its 53% stake in Mascom Wireless Botswana to Econet for $300m (R4.3bn) as it did not have control over that asset. The group would look to offload nonmobile assets such as its investments in tower companies and e-commerce ventures. MTN said on Thursday its subscriber base rose by 16-million customers to 233-million, as service revenues grew 10.7%, from 7.2% growth in 2017. The group’s reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased to 337c from 182c in 2017. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
