Murray & Roberts (M&R), which is in the crosshairs of German company Aton, has bought San Diego-based company Terra Nova Technologies (TNT) for R552m. M&R’s shares were up 4.8% at R13.36 after the company made the announcement on Monday morning. Cementation Americas, which forms part of the Murray & Roberts Underground Mining platform, has bought 100% of TNT for $38m, the construction group said. TNT, which operates from offices in the US and Chile, provides services to the global mining industry and other sectors. “Given the global reach and client network of the Murray & Roberts Underground Mining platform and the number of projects in execution at any time, the potential to grow the TNT business is significant,” M&R said. “TNT’s presence in South America is expected to aid Murray & Roberts’ expansion into this continent.” Meanwhile, Aton, which has made an offer to buy M&R, said on Monday it has until end-June to get approvals for the takeover. Aton said recently it had obtained merger approvals in Zambia and Namibia. The family-owned investment company now has until end-June to get approvals in SA and Canada for its hostile takeover bid. Aton has offered R17 a share, less than the R20-R22 range the M&R board has put out as fair value for the business. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
