Afrox, a supplier of gases and welding products, more than halved its final dividend for the year to end-December as earnings declined, partly due to higher costs. The group said on Wednesday that it would pay a final dividend of 25c a share, from 54c a year earlier. That brings its total dividends for the 2018 financial year to 77c, from 100c previously. Afrox’s net profit slumped 28.3% to R457m in 2018, partly due to higher depreciation and one-off charges, including a restructuring provision of R52m and R55m in impairments against two air-separation units that had repeatedly broken down. Afrox announced its latest restructuring project, partly aimed at reducing fixed costs, in December. “Despite these adverse movements in group operating profit, the underlying growth in strategic markets, solid price cost inflation recovery and continued productivity gains from various efficiency projects, helped mitigate the cost increases,” it said. Revenue was up 6.2% at R6bn thanks to higher volumes in some sectors of the business and “successful recovery of cost inflation as a result of effective pricing management”, the company said. The group said it was contending with “reduced levels of SA business activity”. “Whilst economic growth in SA remains subdued, Afrox will focus on specific growth opportunities arising from the healthcare tender award and will continue with cost containment and effective price cost recoveries.” Afrox’s atmospheric gases business was recently awarded a multiyear government contract worth about R1bn to supply all public hospitals in SA with medical gases. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
