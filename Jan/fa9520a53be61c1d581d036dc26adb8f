The JSE pushed higher on Tuesday morning, with broad-based gains as US and Chinese officials continued trade talks. Commentary from both sides that a deal may be in the offing has provided a fillip for global equities this week. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's comments that the bank may opt to hold back on interest-rate increases despite strong US economic data has also provided some buoyancy in risk assets. Powell's comment on Friday last week have prompted some dollar weakness, which usually supports commodities, as it makes them cheaper to those buying in other currencies. Focus this week will be on the US-China trade talks. Market liquidity remains thin, as most participants have not yet returned to work after the December break, Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking analysts said.
