The JSE was weaker on Thursday morning as concern about US-China trade tension remained at the fore. At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Wednesday Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan alluded to President Donald Trump’s economic policies, warning that the international order was under assault from “unilateralism, protectionism and populism”. “We reject the practices of the strong bullying the weak and self-claimed supremacy,” he said. At the same time, reports show that China is considering buying up to 7-million tons of US wheat to reduce the two countries’ bilateral goods trade imbalance. The fear of slowing global growth, particularly in China, has kept markets volatile as analysts warn that demand for a wide range of commodities and products could weaken this year. Close attention will be paid to the US government shutdown, now one-month long — the longest on record. The US Senate will vote on Thursday night on ending the shutdown, which could trigger volatility in the market.
