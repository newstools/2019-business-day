The Independent Examinations Board (IEB) has recorded a 98.92% matric pass rate for 2018 compared to 2017’s 98.76%. The IEB exam results were released at midnight. Umalusi‚ the examination standardisation body‚ monitored the marking and results and declared the results to be fair and valid‚ according to a statement released by the IEB. It said 11,514 full-time and 858 part-time candidates from 249 examination centres across Southern Africa wrote the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations. This is up fractionally from 11,464 full-time candidates and 666 part-time candidates in 2017. All successful candidates achieved a pass that is good enough to enter tertiary study at one of the three levels: In 2018, the list of designated subjects was removed and there was an increase in the percentage pass rate for entry to bachelor degree studies. Previously, in addition to the normal pass requirements for the NSC, the attainment of 50% or more in a minimum of four designated subjects was required for entry to degree study, the IEB said. Pupils must still get 50% in a minimum of four subjects, however the 50% requirement applied to any subject excluding life orientation. The closing application date for remarking is January 10 2019 and the results from remarking are expected to be released on February 6 2019. The closing date for pupils who qualify to enrol for the supplementary examination is February 15 2019. St John’s College headmaster Paul Edey praised his pupils for the “outstanding set of matric results”. “This has been a truly exceptional year,” he said. “More than 40% of the St John’s class of 2018 achieved an academic average of at least 80%.

More than 35% of the school’s mathematics students achieved an A symbol and 75% of pupils achieved an A symbol in maths literacy. Headmaster Mike Thiel said the class of 2018 “excelled on a number of fronts this year and has produced a set of academic results that reflect their efforts and commitment to achieve their academic potential”.
