Johann Rupert’s Reinet Investments says its net asset value declined by €311m in the quarter end-June, as a result of a share price decline in tobacco company British American Tobacco (BAT). Reinet’s net asset value decreased 6.4% to almost €4.52bn, while net asset value per share fell 5.45% to €23.92, the company said in an operational update on Tuesday. This caused the slice of BAT in Reinet’s overall portfolio to decrease to 46.2% from 52.2% in the prior quarter. BAT’s share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from £31.94 at the end of March to £27.49 to end-June, resulting in a decrease in value of €338m. Dividends of €39m in the period to end-June partially offset the decline in BAT's share price, while the group  saw the value of its stake in UK insurer Pension Insurance Corporation rise almost 4.6% to  €1.55bn. Pension Insurance Corporation is Reinet’s next biggest shareholding, accounting for 34.3% of its portfolio, from 30.6% previously. The company  forked out €29m in share buybacks during the quarter. At 9.15am on Tuesday Reinet’s share price was flat at R241.25, having risen  14.09% so far in 2019. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
