Caroline Cremen from Adviceworx chose Johnson & Johnson as her stock pick of the day. “If you haven’t got your money out the country yet, now is a good time to actually do it. The rand is at a fantastic level, even though the offshore markets are expensive at this point, use the downturn to start to invest in blue-chip dividend producing stocks. The stock I’ve chosen this evening is Johnson & Johnson.”
