Public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan has brushed off intimidation attempts by EFF MPs in Parliament, where he was to deliver his budget vote address on Thursday afternoon. Gordhan was set to deliver his address when EFF MPs started raising multiple points of order to stop him from speaking. They said the minister should not be allowed to address the committee as he was a “constitutional delinquent”.
