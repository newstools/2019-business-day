Maudi Lentsoane from Lehumo Investments chose Sasol as his stock pick of the day. “I’m joining the group that is looking at this from a contrarian point of view. “I like Sasol, I know it has been under a lot of pressure because it is not able to stick to its budgets in the Lake Charles project. But on a project like that, the chances of missing your budget is quite high and it is justifiable.”
