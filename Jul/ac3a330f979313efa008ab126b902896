Gerbrand Smit from NeFG Fund Management chose Zambezi Platinum as his stock pick of the day and Rowan Williams from Nitrogen Fund Managers chose Reinet. Smit said: “I’m going to go with Zambezi Plat, if you want a bit of a more stable upside long-term wise or in the next five or six years, I think that structure is still structured for five or six years.
