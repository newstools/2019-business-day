The rand was flat on Thursday morning at R13.88/$, R17.32/£ and R15.46/€. “The rand remains solidly range bound as it awaits a catalyst event that will determine a breakout course,” said Bianca Botes, treasury partner at Peregrine Treasury Solutions. “In all likelihood, the earliest such event will be the Federal Reserve interest-rate decision taking place next week,” Botes said. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
