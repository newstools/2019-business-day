Liston Meintjes from Nvest Securities chose Northam Platinum as his stock pick of the day and Maudi Lentsoane from Lehumo Investments chose Richemont. Meintjes said: “It’s Northam, a platinum miner, and I’ve got to put the disclaimer upfront and that is: if you believe in platinum. They certainly are moving ahead.” Lentsoane said: “Richemont is a company which is in the luxury business, making all the expensive watches, I think they’re resilient to some of these challenges.”
