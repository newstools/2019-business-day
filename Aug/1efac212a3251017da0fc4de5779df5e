Beverages company Distell, whose brands include Nederburg wines and Three Ships Whisky, says earnings fell in the year to end-June as it took a hit on operations in Angola and Zimbabwe. Soaring inflation and weak macroeconomic fundamentals in those markets have taken their toll on other SA companies with operations there, including packaging company Nampak. Distell said on Wednesday it had written down the value of its investment in African spirits maker Best Global Brands (BGB) by R524m in response to the Angolan kwanza’s 50% decline and the weak economy. “Although BGB has grown volumes and maintained market share since Distell’s investment, the group has decided it would be prudent to impair about two-thirds of the value of its 26% investment in BGB,” Distell said. The group also set aside a credit-loss provision of R266.1m linked to a Zimbabwean associate, which had to settle trading debts owed to Distell in local currency due to foreign exchange shortages. As a result, Distell said basic earnings per share for the year fell by between 44% and 49%, while headline earnings per share declined by up to 6%. The group said normalised headline earnings per share adjusted for currency movements, as well as retrenchment and restructuring costs of R168.6m, rose by up to 9%. This was thanks to “overall comparable revenue growth of more than 9% and margin enhancement”. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
