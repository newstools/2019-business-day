Further signs that the global economy is losing momentum weighed on the JSE on Wednesday morning, with the local bourse slipping back below 55,000 points amid broad-based losses. Chinese industrial output growth in July missed market expectations, rising only 4.8% year on year, compared with the market’s target of 5.8% growth. This is the lowest growth since 2002. “Well, if this isn’t a wake-up call to the People’s Bank of China, I’m not sure what is,” said Vanguard Markets managing partner Stephen Innes in a note. “But in the meantime, the wobbly data should send the market bears back on the prowl.” German data was also subdued, showing that the EU’s largest economy contracted 0.1% in the second quarter of 2019, although this number was expected. Locally, the rand has come off its worst levels of the week, trading 0.3% weaker at R15.1792/$ at 9.40am. The all share had fallen 0.89% to 54,700.9 points and the top 40 had lost 0.85%.
