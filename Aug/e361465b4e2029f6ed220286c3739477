Delta Property Fund and Rebosis Property Fund are considering a merger as this would help the landlords to scale up, they said in a joint announcement on Tuesday. Both real estate investment trusts (Reits) have seen sharp declines in their share prices over the past two years, with SA’s economic slowdown taking its toll on commercial property and mall owners. Rebosis, whose shares are down about 96% from their 2017 highs, has had to contend with the additional pain of a failed bet on the UK market. “The merger represents a natural consolidation of the parties’ shared vision and strategy for the South African real estate market and represents a mutually beneficial step in unlocking value for shareholders,” the landlords said. A merger could help both companies to scale up and diversify, and would probably “enhance the parties’ relationship” with the department of public works and the government. The market currently values Delta at R1.3bn and Rebosis at R343m. A deal could also help them to reduce their costs of capital and improve liquidity for shareholders by creating “a significant player of scale”. The landlords said they would conduct a due diligence process and discuss the potential deal with stakeholders. They would also consider the deal’s structure and make decisions about the new management team and board composition. Delta is led by Sandile Nomvete and Rebosis by Sisa Ngebulana. Rebosis’s shares rose 4.1% in early trade to 51c, while Delta’s were flat at R1.80. Consolidation is taking hold in the listed property sector, although SA Corporate Real Estate said on Monday it was not interested in any of the offers it had received in recent months. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
