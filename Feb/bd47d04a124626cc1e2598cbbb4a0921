Amplats said in a trading statement that its headline earnings per share (HEPS) were expected to about double and its basic earnings to more than triple. “The expected increase in headline earnings and basic earnings is primarily driven by a 13% increase in the rand basket price and improved operational performance,” the company said in its trading statement.
