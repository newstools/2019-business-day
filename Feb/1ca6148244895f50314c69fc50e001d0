The JSE weakened on Thursday morning, although platinum miners continued their gains, amid further signs that the US-China trade war was damaging global economic prospects. As the Chinese manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) earlier fell to a three-year low, while investors were also digesting comments from US officials that a trade deal with China in coming weeks was not assured. This was putting pressure on sentiment, analysts said, with focus now shifting to economic data releases, including the local balance of trade figures for January, and US GDP numbers for the fourth quarter of 2018. At 10am the all share was down 0.72% at 55,892.3 points and the top 40 0.81%. General retailers were down 1.22%, banks 1.13%, industrials 0.77% and food and drug retailers 1.08%. Platinum miners were up 2.67%. Gold was up 0.16% at $1,321.71/oz while platinum was flat at $868.78. Brent crude was down 0.54% at $65.96 a barrel. There was a series of corporate releases on Thursday morning, most of which were disappointing the market. A strike by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) that was due to begin across the gold sector on Thursday evening is also on hold. Gold miners have sought to interdict the strike, with the labour court reserving judgment on the matter after hearing arguments on Wednesday.
