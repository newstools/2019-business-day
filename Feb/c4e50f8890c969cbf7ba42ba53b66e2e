With the launch of its election manifesto at the weekend, the DA reiterated it will oppose any amendments of the constitution to allow the expropriation of land without compensation. The DA’s vote will be crucial in parliament, where a process is under way to amend section 25 of the constitution to enable such expropriation. The constitution can only be changed with a two-thirds majority. Both the DA’s and the EFF’s votes will be crucial to determine any changes in the constitution. The EFF has said it wants all land owned by the state, while the ANC has pushed for expropriation of property under very strict circumstances. Latest opinion polls estimate that the ANC will win the May 8 elections with about 59% of the vote, not enough for it to single-handedly amend the constitution. The DA will come in at about 22% of the vote, while the EFF may poll about 10%, according to the Institute for Race Relations’ latest estimates. The DA would make all South Africans owners of their homes with full title deeds, said leader Mmusi Maimane at the party’s manifesto’s launch in Johannesburg. "We don’t just oppose the amendment of the constitution for the sake of it, we want to ensure that section 25 is protected so that our people can be [property] owners and not tenants of the state," Maimane said. In the party’s 183-page manifesto, the DA says it will give policy certainty to business through guaranteed private property rights that will be upheld for everyone. "We believe in land reform that grows jobs, expands ownership and the economy, and enables economic justice," reads part of the document. "This does not require expropriation or state ownership, but a government capable of using existing provisions in our constitution." mantshantshas@fm.co.za
