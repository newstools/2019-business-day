Precious-stone producer Gemfields says Zambia has suspended a 15% duty on the export of precious gemstones. The Fabergé owner’s two main operating assets are MRM and the Kagem emerald mine in Zambia, in which it holds 75% of each. The company had said that in its six months to end-June the export duty hampered its cash flow at Kagem to the tune of $5m. Zambia had implemented a 15% export duty earlier in 2019, which along with a 6% mineral tax meant Kamem was paying 21% of its revenues to tax authorities. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
