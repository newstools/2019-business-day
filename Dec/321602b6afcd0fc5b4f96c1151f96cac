Nick Kunze from Sanlam Private Wealth chose Investec as his stock pick of the day and Ricus Reeder from PSG Wealth Sandton chose AECI. Kunze said: “Investec is spinning off the asset management arms in the first quarter next year.... Investec is trading under 10 PE with a nice dividend yield.” Reeder said: “AECI, first of all, technical because they’ve gone to about R108 today so that’s a new 52-week high.”
