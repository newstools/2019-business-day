The JSE was lower on Tuesday morning while global markets were mixed as investors mull over the latest trade news. The US said on Monday that it may impose tariffs of up to 100% on $2.4bn (R35bn) worth of French imports including champagne, cheese and handbags saying that France's new digital services tax would affect US tech companies, Reuters reported. This follows comments by US President Trump on Monday that the US would restore tariffs on  steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina. “Traders have had US-China trade tunnel vision. As Americans would say, this came out of left field. The new tariffs in South America are a reminder that with Trump as US President, a phase one trade deal with China doesn’t mean global trade just resets to the old status quo,” London Capital head of research Jasper Lawler said.
