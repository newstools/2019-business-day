The JSE, which has climbed 10.8% so far this year, gave up some of those gains on Thursday morning as global sentiment soured on concerns about the state of major economies. On Wednesday, central banks in Europe and the US added to worries that global economic growth is cooling. Both monetary authorities kept rates on hold, and the European Central Bank (ECB) warned of slower growth in the region. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on imports from the EU. This comes as the US is said to be close to finalising a trade deal with China.

Late on Wednesday, the UK and EU agreed to extend the deadline for Brexit by six months to allow UK Prime Minister Theresa May to find a workable solution. Nigel Driffield, professor of international business at Warwick Business School, said that agreement meant “the cliff edge has been avoided”. He added, “However, nothing has changed in terms of offering business any certainty. The fundamentals of the economy are strong, but too many projects are on hold and that will not change until we know how and when we are leaving the EU and what impact that will have on international trade.” hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
