Remgro’s acquisition of fibre provider Vumatel could be derailed by another Remgro company. In June 2018, Remgro’s Community Investment Ventures Holdings (CIVH) business took a 35% stake in Vumatel and agreed to take full ownership at a later stage. But the second part of the acquisition is being opposed by Octotel, a Cape Town-based competitor to Vumatel that Remgro indirectly controls. Remgro is Johann Rupert’s investment vehicle. “Octotel has raised concerns with the proposed merger and has been permitted to make submissions to the Competition Tribunal as an ‘intervenor’,” the tribunal said in a statement. Even though the Competition Commission recommended that the deal be approved with conditions, “Octotel believes that no conditions can address the concerns it has raised”, the tribunal said ahead of a hearing of the case on Monday morning. Remgro’s investments in the telecommunications sector are making it a more meaningful competitor to fibre-heavyweight Telkom. Remgro’s CIVH also controls Dark Fibre Africa (DFA), a backhaul-services provider that also operates fibre-to-the-home company SA Digital Villages. Rupert’s investment vehicle also has a stake in submarine cable operator Seacom. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
