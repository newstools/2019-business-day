The oil price has risen amid signs that production cuts by oil-cartel Opec are having an effect. The rand was slightly weaker, but the major catalysts this week are only expected in coming days. Brexit, as well as US-China trade talks, continue to dominate the spotlight. At 10am the all share had risen 0.09% to 57,829.1 points while the top 40 had risen 0.12%.
