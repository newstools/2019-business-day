Sibanye-Stillwater said on Tuesday its first-quarter gold production in SA would fall by nearly two-thirds because of a protracted wage strike. The company said on Monday that it would ask the labour court to declare a stoppage by about 14,000 members of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) at its three gold mines unprotected. This came after SA’s largest gold producer claimed a victory when an independent verification process confirmed that Amcu was in the minority at its gold mines. The union, however, said the verification process was “flawed”. The company said on Tuesday production from its SA gold operations in the first quarter of 2019 was expected to be about 104,000oz, or just 36% of what was produced a year before. “Unit operating and all in sustaining costs will be negatively impacted by the reduced production levels,” it said. Sibanye’s shares were 1% down at R17.07 in early trade. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
