Mining veteran Norman Mbazima will retire from Anglo American after 18 years with the company, the multinational miner announced on Friday. Mbazima, the company’s deputy chair, will step down from the post on June 30 this year. In a statement, Anglo CEO Mark Cutifani said Mbazima has made an exceptional contribution to the company over the past 18 years, which he delivered  with tireless energy. Mbazima is originally from Zambia and joined Anglo in 2001 as the finance director at its Konkola Copper Mines before moving up the ranks. He was subsequently appointed CFO for Anglo Coal SA before he became finance director of Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) in 2006, and later stepped in as joint acting CEO. Mbazima went on to become CEO of Scaw Metals from 2008 and headed up Anglo’s SA thermal coal business from 2009 to 2012. Thereafter he served as CEO of Kumba Iron Ore until 2016. “Norman has played a number of critical leadership roles … always bringing a unique perspective to our management team,” Cutifani said. “While Norman will be retiring from his executive responsibilities, I am delighted that he has been appointed non-executive chairman of Anglo American Platinum, our world-class platinum group metals business.” It was announced in October last year that Mbazima would replace Andile Sangqu on the Amplats board. Anglo American said an announcement about its leadership in SA will be made in due course. steynl@businesslive.co.za
