The JSE pushed higher on Tuesday morning, led by Naspers and miners, as Asian markets recovered from recent losses. Investors are awaiting key data releases later in the week, notably first-quarter Chinese GDP numbers on Wednesday, amid concern that the global economy is slowing. The Shanghai Composite pushed firmly higher on Tuesday, snapping three days of losses, amid possible bargain-hunting ahead of Wednesday's economic data. Miners and Naspers were firmly up, but local banks were under a little pressure. The rand was firmer on Tuesday morning, but had weakened back above R14/$ in late trade on Monday. A firmer rand generally benefits local banks. At 10am the all share was up 0.67% to 58,641.2 points and the top 40 had risen 0.74%. Industrials had added 0.93% and the resources index 0.64%.
