Ricus Reeders from PSG Wealth chose Anheuser-Busch InBev as his stock pick of the day and Deryck Janse van Rensburg from Anchor Securities chose Afrimat. Reeders said: “It has been about four to five years since the SAB merger and that is working out on the system. The concern about it has been debt and they have addressed that to a certain extent by changing the terms of that.… At the moment, with a strong rand, which I don’t think is going to persist, rand hedges like Anheuser are probably under pressure, so I would cautiously take a look it specifically because you are getting a good yield of around 5%-6% at the moment and it’s a safer play in a market.” Janse van Rensburg said his stock pick is “a risky one”. “I have looked at the top-40 space and thought, okay, we need to move beyond that and look for something else with a bit of value so, I think there is a management team that I certainly back. They have certainly delivered over the last five years plus in terms of shareholder value that they have created.”
