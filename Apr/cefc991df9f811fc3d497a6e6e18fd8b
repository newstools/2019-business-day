National airline South African Airways (SAA) on Friday said it has increased its  nonstop flights between Washington, DC and Ghana to five days a week. Todd Neuman, SAA’s executive vice-president for North America said the additional flight between Washington’s Dulles International Airport and Accra’s Kotoko International Airport was in response to growing demand for nonstop service between US and Ghana. SAA launched the nonstop service between Dulles Internatioal Airport and Kotoko Internatioal Airport in August 2015. SAA — which serves 57 destinations, in partnership with SA Express, Airlink and Mango — also said it would continue to operate flights between Washington DC and Dakar and Senegal to Johannesburg, two days per week. SAA’s flights between Washington DC and Accra will be plied  by  the Airbus A330-300 and the Airbus A330-200 aircraft. The Johannesburg-Accra-Washington route is lucrative for SAA, which has a partnership with Ghana's Africa World Airlines (AWA). AWA also flies to Lagos in Nigeria, Freetown in Sierra Leone and Monrovia in Liberia. The partnership allows for seamless transfers to North America and the rest of SAA’s international destinations. Partnerships such as the one with AWA enables the loss-making SAA to grow passenger base in the rest of Africa and abroad.
