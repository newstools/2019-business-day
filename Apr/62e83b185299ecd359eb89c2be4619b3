Robert Towell from Sasfin Securities chose to take his money offshore as his stock option for the day. “It’s difficult at this stage with the elections coming up, you don’t want to make too big a call. On the local front, the banks had quite a good run over the last few weeks and you are probably safer within the bank as the banking sector is still paying very good dividends. But if it was me right now, I would take some money offshore.”
