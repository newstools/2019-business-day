Nick Kunze from Sanlam Private Wealth chose Investec Plc as his stock pick of the day and Ricus Reeders from PSG Wealth Sandton chose the Walt Disney Company. Kunze said: “Investec has underperformed against all the other banks recently, it is in corporate action at the moment and spinning off the asset management business. Traditionally we feel that it has been held back by Brexit problems, they are in the wrong space in the UK and the pound has been all over the place. We feel the valuation should be closer to R110 per share. It did have a recent ‘pop-up’ and was trading closer to R91/R92 on Monday.” Reeders said: “Disney has been at the same level for five years, until recently with the announcement of Disney Plus, which is the new subscription service. What has happened is a company that is fairly mature all of a sudden has a growth profile and they will spend a heck of a lot of money in the next five years.… I think for starters they said that if they get enough subscribers, they will be cash positive in the next five years. I think that is an understatement, they will probably do better than that.”
