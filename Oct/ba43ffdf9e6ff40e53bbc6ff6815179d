The rand was weaker on Monday morning, failing to hold on to gains that saw it nearly reach the R15/$ mark in earlier trade, while investors await high-level talks between the US and China this week. The rand's one-week implied volatility was the second-highest among emerging-market currencies on Monday. The currency strengthened to as much as R15.02/$ in intraday trade, a level it has not reached since breaking through the R15/$ mark more than a week ago. It had pared gains by 10am on Monday morning. Markets are shifting their focus to the US-China trade war, which has placed much pressure on risk assets in the past few months. The two economic superpowers will resume high-level, talks later this week with some analysts less optimistic that the two countries will soon reach a complete deal. “There is a lot riding on the outcome of this week’s tête-à-tête between the US and China. Although it is possibly less about exacting an actual trade deal and more about furthering Trump’s campaign for re-election,” RMB analyst Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana said. “Perhaps politicking will be put aside in the interest of global stability. Or perhaps not. The opportunity could be wasted, leaving Twitter alight with Trump’s 280-character critiques  — and markets less assured of a soft landing,” Ramkhelawan-Bhana said.
