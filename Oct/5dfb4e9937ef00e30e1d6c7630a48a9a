The JSE was higher on Monday morning, tracking Asian markets, as trade-war optimism lifted sentiment. China’s commerce ministry said on Saturday that both the US and China have agreed to properly address core issues, adding to hope that the two economic superpowers will soon finalise the phase-one trade deal. Investors are also waiting for the US Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decision on Wednesday amid expectations that it will cut by 25 basis points. “If the Fed delivers a rate cut on Wednesday it will be the third and therefore the question becomes, is the Fed done with their ‘mid-cycle adjustment’ and ‘insurance’ cuts or is this the start of a more significant easing cycle?” said FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed.
