Imtiaz Suliman from Sentio Capital chose Bidcorp as his stock pick of the day. “I’m going with Bidcorp; they have a defensive model whereby they are rolling out food services to smaller food retailers and restaurants. Their margins have also been increasing as they add on new services such as daily deliveries.”
