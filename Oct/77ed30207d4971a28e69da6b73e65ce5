The JSE was subdued on Thursday morning, while global markets were mixed as focus shifts to economic data from the US. Manufacturing and industrial production figures will be in the spotlight on Thursday as markets continue to bet on the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut its interest rate for the third time in 2019. Rate cut hopes were bolstered by US retail sales, which fell for the first time in seven months, adding to concerns about the health of the US economy. “While a single economic release isn’t enough to conclude that consumers are becoming more cautious, it may strengthen the belief that the weakness in other parts of the economy will translate into less consumer spending,” FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed said. “Given that a rate cut is mostly priced into markets, any development in trade and earnings will guide the direction of equities and fixed income assets,” Sayed said.
