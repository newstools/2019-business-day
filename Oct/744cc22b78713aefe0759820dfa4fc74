Caroline Cremen from Adviceworx chose CoreShares Global Divtrax as her stock pick of the day. “With the rand being where it is, I can’t pick my favourite offshore, but I’m going to say that the best place to hide in a poor economic environment is dividend stocks, CoreShares Global Divtrax exchange-traded funds.”
