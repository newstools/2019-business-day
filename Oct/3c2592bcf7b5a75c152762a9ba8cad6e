You could soon be adding the fourth limited edition of Three Ships Whisky’s Masters Collection to your private collection - just in time for the fast-approaching holiday season. Only 402 of the 2,940 bottles in this limited-edition 9-Year-Old Fino Cask Finish will be sold in an online exclusive sale on October 24 2019. With this limited release, collectors can expect a beautiful blend of the finest grain and malt whiskies consisting of lovely expressions of Fino Sherry. In the palate, this whisky opens up with peat, treacle syrup, tobacco, spice and a playful nuttiness. The whisky collection was first matured for five years in old American oak, which was then released into seasoned Fino Sherry casks for a further maturation period of four years.  During the crafting stage Three Ships Whisky master distiller Andy Watts, saw an unravelling of extraction from the wood over the four-year period and carefully selected four casks that he deemed to offer the optimal flavour composition. The whisky is un-chillfiltered and natural in colour, presented in its purest form at a strength of 48.6% ABV. The online exclusive will be hosted by Andy Watts, as well as renowned television star and influencer Maps Maponyane.  Whisky lovers can also expect to witness artist Pierre Coetzee create a one-of-a-kind artwork inspired by the blend in real time.
