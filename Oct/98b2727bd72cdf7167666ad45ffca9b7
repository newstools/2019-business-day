The JSE was subdued on Tuesday morning, tracking European markets as investors shifted their focus to UK parliament's debate on Brexit later on Tuesday. UK MPs are expected to debate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill over the next three days as the October 31 Brexit deadline approaches. “This process is all too familiar. I'm already having flashbacks to March and the various amendments and late evening votes. This will likely be more painful again,” Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said. “From a trader's perspective, the next few days may bring a few minor setbacks, but they'll likely be viewed as more of an over-hyped procedural affair, that one that could derail a smooth Brexit,” Erlam said.
