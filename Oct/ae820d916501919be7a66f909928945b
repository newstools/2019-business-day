Investors will shift their focus to the US non-farm payrolls to be released later in the day. The data is considered an important indicator of the state of the US economy. Concerns of an economic slowdown in the world’s largest economy were bolstered this week after manufacturing data dropped to a decade low in September, fuelling expectations that the Fed may cut the interest rate at their two remaining meetings for the year. Market’s will also monitor Fed chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday. “Powell’s remarks will also be analysed for clues as to policymakers’ bias over the coming months, especially following waning confidence over the health of the world’s largest economy,” market analyst at FXTM Han Tan said.
