The rand slipped as much as 1% against the dollar on Wednesday morning, extending earlier losses, after Eskom said it would resume load-shedding. The economic effects of load-shedding remain a major headwind for the rand, with unreliable electricity considered a major reason SA’s economy contracted 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019. “What will be much more important is whether this headline has more legs [namely] is it just for today or is this going to be a recurring nightmare?” Standard Bank currency dealer Warrick Butler said. Butler said the timing of the latest load-shedding is “not great” considering that Moody’s Investors Service’s decision on SA’s credit rating is scheduled for November. At 9.30am the rand was 0.88% down at R15.0172/$, having earlier fallen as much as 1.1%. The rand had also weakened 0.92% to R16.575/€ and 0.18% to R19.0686/£. The euro was flat $1.1037. Gold added 0.25% to $1,484.65/oz wile platinum was flat at $882.87. Brent crude lost 0.12% to $58.77 a barrel. Stats SA is expected to release retail sales for August later in the day. Bloomberg’s median forecast is for an increase of 1.7%, from 2% in July. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
