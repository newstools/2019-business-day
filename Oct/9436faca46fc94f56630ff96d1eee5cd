Wealth and asset manager Peregrine Holdings said on Friday that its headline earnings per share (HEPS) are likely to have dropped by as much as 45% in the six months to end-September. The group, which includes wealth manager Citadel, and asset managers Peregrine Capital and Stenham, said it expects its HEPS and earnings per share (EPS) to fall by between 35% and 45% to between 45.1c and 57.9c. The company said in June that it grappled with deal-flow, citing difficult financial market conditions after its performance fee related income fell 65% to R95m in the year to end-March. Peregrine said ongoing HEPS for the period are expected to increase by between 10% and 15%. The groupâ€™s financial results for the six months to end-September 2019 are scheduled to be released on November 13. mjoo@businesslive.co.za
