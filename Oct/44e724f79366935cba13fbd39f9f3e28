The JSE was lower on Monday morning, in line with European markets as investors ponder the latest developments in the US-China trade war. The US and China agreed on a partial deal on Friday as the two economic superpowers held high-level talks in Washington last week. The US agreed to suspend a tariff increase on $250bn worth of Chinese imports while the latter said it would purchase more US agricultural products. “Given how fast the wind can change direction, investors will likely prevent from crying victory too soon. Chinese news, for example, didn’t refer to the outcome of last week’s negotiations as a ‘deal’, to avoid fuelling expectations too fast, too soon,” said London Capital Group senior market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya Earlier, the Shanghai Composite added 1.15%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 0.81% while Japan’s Nikkei 225 was closed for a public holiday.
