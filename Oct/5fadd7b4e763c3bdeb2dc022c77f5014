Deryck Janse van Rensburg from Anchor Securities chose dollar cash as his stock pick of the day and Rowan Williams from Nitrogen Fund Managers chose Datatec. Janse Van Rensburg said: “I’m using the strong rand to buy dollars, I do think that the US markets are quite elevated, but I’m going to be patient.” Williams said: “Datatec, and it’s a little bit speaking to what Deryck is saying. It’s a rand hedge and is exposed to a number of emerging markets, so dollar-based earnings and really a turn-a-round story.”
