The JSE was higher on Monday morning  with resources leading gains, while global markets were mixed amid uncertainty regarding Brexit. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has written to Brussels seeking to delay the October 31 deadline for the UK to leave the EU after MPs voted not to back Johnson's proposed Brexit deal on Saturday. “The pressure is unlikely to ease up on MPs though, just because the extension request was sent to Brussels. Until they confirm that it's been accepted, there is still a risk of no deal Brexit in 10 days’ time. The EU could wait until late in the day before accepting an extension in an attempt to pressure MPs to back Johnson's deal,” Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said.
