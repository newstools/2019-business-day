The JSE started the week in positive territory with gold miners leading gains while investors remain cautious ahead of trade negations between the US and China. Chinese and US officials are expected to resume negotiations in Washington this week, with markets sceptical that the US and China will reach a trade deal this week. “With trade talks occurring later in the week, there will be some hope that progress can be made towards ending the trade war that has weakened the global economy. It's probably far more likely that a deal is as far away as it is now and a no-deal Brexit remains the most likely outcome,” senor market analyst at Oanda Craig Erlam said.
