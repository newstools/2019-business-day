The JSE was little changed on Thursday morning, with global markets subdued by US-China trade war jitters, while local focus is on mining data for September. There is concern about SA's third-quarter performance, with Statistics SA saying on Wednesday that retail sales increased just 0.2% year on year in September, missing market expectations of a rise of 1.9%. Mining is expected to fall 2.4% year on year in September, an improvement from the 3.2% fall in August. Global markets have been subdued by a lack of progress in the US-China trade war, with reports suggesting that there are disagreements between the two sides on a partial deal reached in October. “Markets continue to trade in narrow ranges in fairly lacklustre trade as a lack of progress on the trade deal front dampens investor optimism,” TreasuryOne senior currency dealer Andre Botha said in a note.
