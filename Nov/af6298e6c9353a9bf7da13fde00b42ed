Kwame Antwi from KOA Capital chose Bidcorp as his stock pick of the day. “In the current environment I’m fairly bearish on the currency, I'm fairly bearish on SA economy. I think we have a lot of headwinds, despite the optimism and some of the things we and the government seem to be doing. I think it’s going to take a while before we see the economy turn around and so I’m always in favour of businesses that have international consumer play.”
