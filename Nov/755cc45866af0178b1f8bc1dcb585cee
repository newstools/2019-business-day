The JSE was higher on Monday, tracking Asian markets after China cut its interest rate for the first time since 2015. China lowered its short-term funding rate by five basis points to 2.50% amid a wave of monetary policy easing among developed economies. Sentiment has been supported by reports that the US and China are making progress in their discussions ahead of signing a partial trade deal. “While this is arguably a positive conversation that enables a deal to be reached, we were meant to be at the point of agreeing on a date and location for it to be signed off. Trump looks to have been a little premature in his assertion that a deal was done last month, with there clearly still being plenty more work to do,”  Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said.
