The JSE fell in broad-based losses on Friday, taking its lead from Asian markets, even as volumes were subdued by the closure of US markets on Thursday. There is an absence of major global data releases on Friday, with investor attention remaining on the US-China trade war. The market is waiting for a Chinese response to the US stance on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that provides for an annual review of Hong Kong’s trading relationship, an issue that may provoke intransigence from Beijing during trade talks. While the Hong Kong bill is providing poor optics, signing the deal into law was expected, said AxiTrader chief Asian market strategist Stephen Innes in a note. It had, however, now left investors speculating on the “resolute countermeasure” China will take, and whether it would be enough to damage trade talks, said Innes.
