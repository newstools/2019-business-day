The JSE was in positive territory on Tuesday, in line with most  global markets as investors await more news on the US-China trade war. CNBC reported that China is concerned about the trade deal  after US President Donald Trump said the US would not withdraw tariffs. “There have been reports that the US trade team has been exploring rolling back some tariffs to get this over the line and the refusal to engage by Trump could simply be posturing, but time is running out if they want it signed this year,” Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said. “That's looking increasingly unlikely but as yet, investors are not losing faith with US equity markets holding at record highs and setting new records on an almost daily basis.” Erlam said.
