Ricus Reeders from PSG Wealth Sandton chose BHP Group as his stock pick of the day and Nick Crail from Ashburton Investments chose Alibaba. Reeders said: “BHP Group as a company has a strong balance sheet and is well geographically diversified.” Crail said: “I think after the recent rally and SA Inc shares I would say towards fair value, specifically across the consumer stocks, looking around for where there is value in the globe at the moment and I do believe it’s in China.”
