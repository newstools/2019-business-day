Retailer Woolworths has  gained market share in its food and fashion businesses in the 20 weeks to November 17. In SA, food sales jumped 8.8%, with comparable store sales rising 6.5% compared with the 20 weeks to November 11, the company said in an update on Wednesday. The group’s fashion, beauty and home segment grew sales 2.8% during the period,  ahead of market share growth as reported by the retail liaison committee for October, the company said. In Australia, David Jones sales declined 2.1%, with the company saying a store refurbishment contributed to the decline. Comparable store sales, including online, declined 0.7%, the company said. Country Road sales declined 4.7%. Woolworths had acquired David Jones in 2014, and the group’s performance has consistently been below expectations. The group has written down David Jones a number of times, including a 437.4-million Australian dollar (R4.4bn) write-down for its year ended June 2019. Woolworths, which paid R21.5bn for David Jones, valued that business at about R9.65bn at end-June. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
