The JSE joined a trend of lower global markets on Wednesday morning, with investor sentiment hit by a series of comments by US President Donald Trump on Tuesday. In a speech in New York, Trump hit out at the EU for its tariffs, while also not offering any hope that the US is considering rolling back tariffs on China, following a partial deal reached in October. Trump, in fact, threatened to “substantially” raise tariffs on China, which, along with ongoing protests in Hong Kong, was giving investors cold feet, said London Capital Group senior market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya in a note.
