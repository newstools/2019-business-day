Volkswagen was the most awarded vehicle manufacturer at the 2019 Gumtree Auto Pre-Owned Awards, walking away with eight accolades. The awards, which are now in their third year, were held in Johannesburg recently. The judging criteria include interior quality, standard features, durability, performance, fuel economy, maintenance costs and resale value. Only 2017 models with at least six months of depreciation data were considered. “Twice as many used cars are bought annually in SA than new ones, and the third annual Gumtree Auto Pre-Owned Awards have helped identify the best of the best through a panel of expert judges as well as close to 70,000 votes from South Africans,” said Nunben Dixon, head of automotive at Gumtree. Out of the 20 vehicle brands represented at this year’s awards, Volkswagen was the night’s biggest winner for the second year in a row with eight wins out of 16 nominations across both the judges’ and people’s choice awards.
