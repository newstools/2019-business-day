The JSE was up on Monday morning, tracking global markets as the latest developments in the US-China trade war aided risk assets. US national security adviser Robert O' Brien said at the weekend that a phase-one trade agreement may be concluded by the end of 2019, CNBC reported. According to reports, China will raise penalties on the violation of intellectual property rights, adding to hope that the two economic superpowers are making progress to resolve the 16-month-long trade war. “The move suggests that key concessions are being made to increase the prospects of a partial US-China deal, which is giving investors another opportunity to capitalise on risk-on trading activity,” FXTM market analyst Han Tan said.
