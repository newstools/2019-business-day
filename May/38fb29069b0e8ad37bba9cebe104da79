With 21.15% of the vote counted by 7.30am on Thursday, the ANC had garnered 54.71% of the national vote, followed by the DA, with 26.41%, and the EFF, with 7.98%. The election day was marred by logistical issues, leaving many, especially political parties, upset. However, the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) has said glitches at the poll will not affect the credibility of the election. The May 8 poll was touted as the most hotly contested since 1994. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) said the expected turnout for this election was 71% at this stage. One of the main battlegrounds in this election was the fight for the country’s economic hub of Gauteng. The DA was hoping to bring the ANC below 50% in the province. If this happens, Gauteng could be governed through a coalition. Only 12.52% of the vote had been counted in the province on Thursday morning. At the time, the ANC had 51.64% of the vote and the DA 27.01%. The EFF had 13.36%. According to the CSIR, it was still too early to give a good prediction of what could happen in Gauteng, since the counting at a number of large township areas had not been reported as yet. It said the province’s predictions were still fluctuating widely. In the Western Cape, where the DA is hoping to retain its hold, 36.8% of the vote had been counted. The DA was leading with 56.97%, followed by the ANC with 26.78%. In third place in the province was Patricia de Lille’s Good party with 3.33% of the vote. quintalg@businesslive.co.za
