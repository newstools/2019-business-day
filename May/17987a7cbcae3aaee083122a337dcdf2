Building materials supplier Afrimat says earnings rose 29.6% in the year to end-February, thanks in part to higher iron ore prices. Group revenue rose 24.6% to R3bn, while headline earnings per share grew 29.6% to 234.1c, the group said on Thursday. “Afrimat’s entry into bulk commodities two years ago proved to be well-timed, contributing handsomely to the sustained earnings growth. “Healthy international iron ore prices turned the recently acquired Demaneng iron ore mine into a star performer,” the group said. This helped offset a difficult period for the construction-materials division. “Our construction-materials segment felt the brunt of the slowdown in economic activity, with the KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng businesses being impacted the most,” said Afrimat CEO Andries van Heerden. Afrimat said net cash from operating activities increased by 46.4% to R410.5m, allowing it to reduce its net debt-to-equity ratio to 23.8% from 35.5%. The company said it would pay a final dividend of 62c a share, versus 42c a year before. Total dividends for the year amounted to 81c per share, from 62c previously. Afrimat said in April it had made an offer to buy Australia-listed Universal Coal. It would pay up to A$0.40 per Universal share. A due-diligence process is under way, Afrimat said. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
