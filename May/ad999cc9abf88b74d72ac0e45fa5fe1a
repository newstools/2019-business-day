CNBC reported on Wednesday that the US and China could announce a trade deal by next Friday, ending a prolonged period of discussions that have stoked uncertainty.

It was flat against the pound and euro at R18.83 and R16.16, respectively. “We expect the rand to run into some resistance at the R14.50/$ level, and settle in the mid R14.40s,” said Andre Botha, dealer at TreasuryOne. “However, we are in the final stretches of the election process and the market will be on tenterhooks for any headlines that could cause the rand to wobble some more.” He said Investors would shift their attention to US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
