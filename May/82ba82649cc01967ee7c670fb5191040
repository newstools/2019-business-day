Capitec Bank co-founder and chair Riaan Stassen, who played a significant role in shaking up SA’s banking industry, will retire from the financial services group at the end of May. Capitec, whose plans to disrupt the banking industry were met with some suspicion when it launched in 2001, has become a sector heavyweight partly by making financial services more accessible. At last count, Capitec had 11.4-million clients — more than Nedbank. The lender is catching up with Absa, Standard Bank and FNB. In late March, Capitec said its headline earnings in the year ended February 2019 rose 19% to R5.3bn, a better growth rate than any of its main rivals. “Riaan played an integral role in the establishment and success of the bank from 2001 to 2013, when he retired as CEO of Capitec and Capitec Bank,” the group said on Thursday. Stassen has served as non-executive chair of the boards since 2016. At the end of February, he owned 0.67% of Capitec, according to the group’s annual report. Thanks to the lender’s shares surging from R2.75 on listing in 2002 to R1,333.08 on Thursday, that stake was worth about R1bn on Thursday. Capitec said Santie Botha, chair of Curro Holdings and Famous Brands and a non-executive director at Telkom, would take over as chair of the boards from June 1. “Santie’s appointment will strengthen the independent element of the boards and support the continual drive to augment board acumen,” Capitec said. Botha, a former chancellor of Nelson Mandela University, has served on the boards of Liberty Holdings, Imperial Holdings, Tiger Brands, MTN Group, Absa and Unilever. hedleyn@businesslive.co.za
