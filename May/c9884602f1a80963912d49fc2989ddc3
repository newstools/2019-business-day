With 75% of the vote counted on Friday morning, the ANC is on 57.1%; the DA on 21.84%; and the EFF on 10.08%. These percentages are close to what the final result will look like, according to projections from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The most keenly awaited result remains that for Gauteng, where only 55.79% of the vote has been counted. The ANC sits on 50.82% and could avoid the need for a coalition government by a whisker. Several large township results, which are considered ANC strongholds, are still outstanding, giving the ANC hope that it will be able to form a government on its own. Live results of the national vote in the 2019 general election Counting is most advanced in the Northern Cape and Western Cape and it is expected that these results will be largely completed on Friday morning. The DA looks set to retain the Western Cape comfortably, but with a much-reduced majority of about 54.7%. The party will also be disappointed with its performance in the Northern Cape, where it had hoped to improve its standing far more than it has. With 97% of the vote counted, the ANC is on 57.25% and the DA on 25.89%. In 2014 the DA made massive gains in the province, winning 23.6% of the vote, a 10 percentage point jump from its performance in 2009. The Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) says that, based on results so far, the overall turnout for the election is 65%, compared with a 73.48% turnout in the 2014 national elections.
