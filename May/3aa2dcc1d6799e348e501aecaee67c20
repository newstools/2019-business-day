With 87.3% of the vote counted by 1.40pm on Friday, the ANC was set to retain a weakened majority, sitting on 57.21%, with the DA on 21.28% and the EFF on 10.24%. These percentages are close to what the final result will look like, according to projections from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). PODCAST: Smaller parties suspect fraud The focus stayed on Gauteng, the most populated province and key battleground, where more than 30% of the votes are still outstanding. At the time of reporting, the ANC was still just below the needed 50% mark, at 49.65%. The DA was on 28.24% and the EFF on 14.11%. Large parts of Tshwane remain outstanding. Live results of the provincial vote for Gauteng in the 2019 general election Counting has since been concluded in the Northern Cape and North West, where the ANC managed to retain control. Although about 1% of votes still needed to be finalised, the DA will retain the Western Cape comfortably, but with a much-reduced majority of about 55.63%. The party will also be disappointed with its performance in the Northern Cape, where it had hoped to improve its standing far more than it has. The ANC secured 57.54% of the vote and the DA 25.51%. In 2014, the DA made massive gains in the province, winning 23.6% of the vote, a 10 percentage point jump from its performance in 2009. The Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) says that, based on results so far, the overall turnout for the election was 65%, compared with a 73.48% turnout in the 2014 national elections. patonc@businesslive.co.za
