Election day was marred by logistical issues, leaving many political parties upset. However, the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) has said glitches at the poll would not affect the credibility of the election. The May 8 poll was touted as the most hotly contested since 1994. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) said the expected turnout for the 2019 election was about 71%.

Over 47% of the vote had been counted in Gauteng on Thursday by 7.30pm. At the time, the ANC had 51.85% of the vote and the DA 26.07%. The EFF had 14.45%.
