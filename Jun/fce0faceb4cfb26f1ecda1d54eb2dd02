The JSE is likely to open mixed on Thursday as traders await updates on US trade negotiations. US stocks pushed higher overnight on hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, but trade talks with Mexico ended without a resolution on Wednesday. “Markets will continue to monitor the progress of the negotiations closely, which will resume today,” analysts at OCBC Bank in Singapore said. “Separately, President Trump is facing more resistance within his own Republican Party on his tariff threat to Mexico. This may give hopes both sides will eventually reach a deal,” OCBC said. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was 0.2% up on Thursday, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.5%.
