Viv Govender from Rand Swiss Offshore chose oil as his stock pick of the day. “Right now my pick is the oil price, at around $60-$61 a barrel is very good to get into. I do think it may go lower with another $10.... Shell is one of the reasons that we have seen the oil prices come down. I do think there is a lot of upside possibility as a number of producers out there are really vulnerable.”
