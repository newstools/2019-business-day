US equities rose for a third straight day on Thursday on rising hopes of a trade deal between the US and Mexico. While markets in China and Hong Kong are closed for holidays on Friday, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.6% and Korea’s Kospi 0.4%. Australia’s main benchmark gained 0.7%, with JSE-listed BHP Group jumping 2% in that market. On the JSE, property developer Attacq will provide a year-to-date update to shareholders on Friday morning. The SA Reserve Bank is scheduled to release data on gold and foreign exchange reserves, and statements of assets and liabilities.
