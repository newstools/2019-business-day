Nesan Nair from Sasfin Securities chose British American Tobacco (BAT) as his stock pick of the day and Wayne McCurrie from FNB Wealth & Investments did not have a stock pick this week. Nair said: “I’m going to go with British American Tobacco, I looked at the dividend yields and I think there’s sufficient margin a safety there for the long-term investor so British American Tobacco for me.” McCurrie said: “I don’t have one because we’re waiting for [US President Donald] Trump this weekend. Now there are three things that he can do.”
