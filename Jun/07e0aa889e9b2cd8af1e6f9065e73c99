Nesi Chetty from Stanlib chose Equites Property Fund as his stock pick of the day. “My stock pick is a company we’ve liked for a while, it’s called Equites. It’s got a very large local portfolio, the size is about R12bn. They’ve done quite well in that logistic space. They own, manage and develop logistic containers, and the yields on that are very attractive.”
