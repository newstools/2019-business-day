The JSE was lower on Monday morning, in line with some global markets as news that the US may consider limiting its capital flows to China weighed on sentiment. Reports that the US administration is considering restricting capital flows into China, including possibly delisting Chinese companies from US stock exchanges, dampened investor appetite for riskier assets. “While no confirmation was received on this front, the idea of the trade war moving into a war on capital flows will lead to a risk-off environment. Whether the White House would implement such restrictions or just use them as a tool to gain leverage in the upcoming trade negotiations, the message sent was not received well by financial markets,” FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed said.
