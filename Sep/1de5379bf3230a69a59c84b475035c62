Viv Govender from Rand Swiss Offshore says he is taking profits from his rand trade. “I’m not investing but taking profits in my rand trade, the last time I was on the show I mentioned it was around R15.20 to the dollar and I said to go long on the rand, which is now at around R14.60, so you would have made some money, so get out.”
