The JSE bounced back on Thursday, gaining for the first day this week as global markets picked up after US President Donald Trump's comments that the US and China could soon reach a trade deal. Trump said on Wednesday that the two economic superpowers were having “good” talks and that they could soon reach an agreement. Global equities were knocked on Wednesday after the US House said it would launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump for allegedly seeking help from Ukranian authorities to investigate former US vice-president Joe Biden. “It is unsure how the ongoing impeachment inquiry would impact Trump’s mood in October's trade negotiations, but we believe that he may concentrate his efforts in sealing a much-desired trade deal with China to divert the market’s attention from his impeachment inquiry and get the stock markets racing higher,” London Capital Group senior market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya said.
