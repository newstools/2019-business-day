Q: I’ve received notice of a Sars tax refund via SMS and e-mail. I could tell from the website address (I did not click on it) that it was a hoax e-mail. I use the Sars MobiApp. Am I at risk of being scammed? – Anonymous via e-mail. A: Brian Pinnock, cyber security expert at Mimecast answers: You are usually at risk of being scammed if you click on a link or open an attachment in an SMS or e-mail. (There are unfortunately a few types of attacks that simply require you to open an e-mail, but these usually only work on older versions of e-mail software such as outdated versions of Microsoft Outlook.) There are essentially two types of phishing attacks: In both cases never click on links or open attachments. Always manually type in the full website URL rather than using your browser history or clicking on a link. The Sars MobiApp has similar security to that of a mobile banking application and uses two-factor authentication which is strong but not infallible. Criminals usually use either a SIM swap technique or phone the victim on some pretext to try to get access to your one-time PIN. Sars says on its website that it will never request your banking details in any communication that you receive via post, e-mail, or SMS. However, for the purpose of telephonic engagement and authentication purposes, Sars will verify your personal details. Importantly, Sars will not send you any hyperlinks to other websites, even those of banks.
