The profitability of SA's seven-largest commercial banks should remain resilient through the course of 2020, despite low business confidence and stagnant income growth for SA citizens, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday. While subdued growth will constrain the growth of balance sheets for SA banks and reduce loan growth, capital will remain resilient and comfortably above regulatory minimums over the next 18 months, Moody's said in its latest banking system  outlook for SA. Funding and liquidity conditions should remain stable, Moody's said, as it maintained its stable outlook for the sector. Banks returns on assets should remain roughly in line with their 2018 performance at 1.8%. Problematic loans should rise marginally from 3.7% during that period, but remain below 4%. “Our stable outlook for the banking system is consistent with the current stable outlook on the government credit rating and on  of the country's largest banks,” Moody's said. Moody's expects SA to see GDP growth of just 0.7% in 2019 and 1.5% in 2020, too low to meaningfully reduce unemployment or support per capita income growth. “We expect the government to continue to pursue reform policies that attempt to stimulate growth. However, SA has one of the highest levels of income inequality globally, as measured by the Gini index,” Moody's said. JSE-listed banks have under performed so far in 2019, falling 3.95% so far, compared to a 4.53% rise in the local bourse. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
